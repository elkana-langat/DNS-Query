# Impliment DNS in a weekend

A DNS resolver is a program that knows how to figure out what the IP address for a domain is.  

Here's what the command line interface of the resolver looks like:

`$ python3 resolve.py example.com  
93.184.216.35`

This project is a fun way to learn:

- How to parse a binary network protocol like DNS
- How DNS works under the hood (What's happening behind the scenes when you make a DNS query?)
